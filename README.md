## Description
This is an application that will help users create an extremely strong password based of the criteria they select. Users are prompted to choose whether they want their password to be between 8 and 128 characters, and whether to consist of Numeric, Special, and upper and lowercase characters. After all criteria has been entered a randomly generated password will appear on screen.
